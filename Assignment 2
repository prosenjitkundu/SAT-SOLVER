📌 Overview

This project implements the Mastermind game by modeling it as a constraint satisfaction problem and solving it using a Boolean SAT Solver. The system consists of a codemaker that generates a secret code and a codebreaker that intelligently deduces the code using logical constraints derived from feedback.

The implementation strictly follows the academic specification provided in CS69011 – Computing Lab I, Assignment 3 at IIT Kharagpur  ￼.

🎯 Key Features
	•	Intelligent codebreaker that avoids contradictory guesses using SAT constraints
	•	Supports both unique-color codes and repeated-color codes
	•	Models Mastermind rules using Boolean variables and CNF clauses
	•	Guarantees logically valid guesses based on prior feedback
	•	Demonstrates practical use of SAT solvers in AI reasoning problems

⸻

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Language: C
	•	Concepts: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), Constraint Solving
	•	Tools: SAT Solver (DIMACS CNF format), UNIX environment
	•	Core Topics: AI reasoning, logical modeling, problem solving

⸻

🧩 How It Works
	1.	The codemaker randomly selects a hidden code.
	2.	The codebreaker generates guesses using a SAT solver.
	3.	Feedback (black & white pegs) is translated into Boolean constraints.
	4.	Constraints are accumulated and fed back into the solver.
	5.	The process repeats until the correct code is deduced.

This approach ensures every guess is logically consistent with all previous feedback.
